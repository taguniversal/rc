# Reality Compiler (rc)

**Copyright (c) 2025 CryptoLogic LLC**

## Overview

Reality Compiler (`rc`) is an advanced multi-domain compilation framework that translates abstract computational descriptions into hardware, software, and physical structures. It provides a unified language for designing and implementing logic at every scale—silicon, circuits, computation, and even large-scale industrial fabrication.

## Features

- **Multi-Target Compilation**: Generate SPIR-V for GPU execution, VHDL for FPGA deployment, netlists for PCB design, and COLLADA models for 3D visualization.
- **Structured Abstraction**: Accepts logic definitions in Invocation Language and transforms them into optimized representations at each stage of compilation.
- **Hierarchical Processing**: Breaks down computational expressions into an intermediate netlist representation before targeting specific implementations.
- **AI-Assisted Design**: Interfaces with AI-driven heuristics to recommend optimal components, materials, and layouts based on engineering constraints.
- **Material-Aware Synthesis**: Extends beyond digital logic to produce manufacturing-ready artifacts incorporating specific materials and physical properties.
- **Fabrication-Ready Outputs**: Emits structured data compatible with standard industry tools, including KiCad, OpenSCAD, and semiconductor mask formats.

```

## Installation

Reality Compiler is built using Meson and Ninja.

```sh
meson setup build
ninja -C build
```

## Usage

To compile an Invocation Language script:

```sh
build/invoke_compiler input/full_add.inv -o output
```

This will generate corresponding outputs across all targeted domains.

### Running SPIR-V Validation and Disassembly

```sh
ninja -C build disassemble_spirv
ninja -C build validate_spirv
```

## Future Directions

Reality Compiler is evolving into a full-stack synthesis pipeline that can generate optimized computation, hardware, and material blueprints from a single logical description. Future plans include direct integration with semiconductor fabs for mask generation and AI-driven hardware-software co-design.
